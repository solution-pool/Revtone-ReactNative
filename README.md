# How to build the project: android_version

First of all install node_modules using

```sh
npm install 
or
yarn install
```


and then
```sh
npx jetify
```


finally
```sh
npm start
```


- Here, you may have @override issue. Then please remove just that @override decoration and keep going
- <code>npx jetify</code> every time when your dependencies update or every time you install node_modules you have to jetify again
